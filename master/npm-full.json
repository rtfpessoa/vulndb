        "description": "## Overview\n[bl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bl) is a storage object for collections of Node Buffers.\n\nA possible memory disclosure vulnerability exists when a value of type `number` is provided to the `append()` method and results in concatination of uninitialized memory to the buffer collection. \n\nThis is a result of unobstructed use of the `Buffer` constructor, who's [insecure default constructor increases the odds of memory leakage](https://snyk.io/blog/exploiting-buffer/).\n\n## Details\nConstructing a `Buffer` class with integer `N` creates a `Buffer` of length `N` with raw (not \"zero-ed\") memory.\n\nIn the following example, the first call would allocate 100 bytes of memory, while the second example will allocate the memory needed for the string \"100\":\n```js\n// uninitialized Buffer of length 100\nx = new Buffer(100); \n// initialized Buffer with value of '100'\nx = new Buffer('100'); \n```\n\n`bl`'s `append` function uses the default `Buffer` constructor as-is, making it easy to append uninitialized memory to an existing list. If the value of the buffer list is exposed to users, it may expose raw server side memory, potentially holding secrets, private data and code. This is a similar vulnerability to the infamous [`Heartbleed`](http://heartbleed.com/) flaw in OpenSSL.\n\n```js\nconst BufferList = require('bl')\n\nvar bl = new BufferList()\nbl.append(new Buffer('abcd'))\nbl.append(new Buffer('efg'))\nbl.append('100')\n// appends a Buffer holding 100 bytes of uninitialized memory\nbl.append(100)                     \nbl.append(new Buffer('j'))\n```\n\nYou can read more about the insecure `Buffer` behavior [on our blog](https://snyk.io/blog/exploiting-buffer/).\n\nSimilar vulnerabilities were discovered in [request](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:request:20160119), [mongoose](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:mongoose:20160116), [ws](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20160104) and [sequelize](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:sequelize:20160115).\n\n## References\n- https://github.com/rvagg/bl/pull/22\n- https://github.com/rvagg/bl/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.1\n- https://snyk.io/blog/exploiting-buffer/\n",

        "description": "## Overview\n[`cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli) is an npm package used for rapidly building command line apps. \n\nWhen used in `daemon` mode, the library makes insecure use of two files in the `/tmp/` folder: `/tmp/<app-name>.pid` and `/tmp/<app-name>.log`. These allow an attacker to overwrite files they typically cannot access, but that are accessible by the user running the CLI-using app. This is possible since the `/tmp/` folder is (typically) writeable to all system users, and because the names of the files in question are easily predicted by an attacker.\n\nNote that while this is a real vulnerability, it relies on functionality (`daemon` mode) which is only supported in very old Node versions (0.8 or older), and so is unlikely to be used by most `cli` users. To avoid any doubt, the fixed version (1.0.0) removes support for this feature entirely. \n\n## Details\nFor example, assume user _victim_ occasionally runs a CLI tool called `cli-tool`, which uses the `cli` package.\nIf an attacker gains write access to the `/tmp/` folder of that machine (but not the higher permissions _victim_ has), they can create the symbolic link `/tmp/cli-tool.pid -> /home/victim/important-file`. When _victim_ runs `cli-tool`, the `important-file` in victim's root directory will be nullified. If the CLI tool is run as root, the same can be done to nullify `/etc/passwd` and make the system unbootable. \n\nNote that popular CLI tools have no reason to mask their names, and so attackers can easily guess a long list of tools victims may run by checking the `cli` package [dependents](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/cli).\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `cli` to version `1.0.0` or greater, which disables the affected feature.\n\nFrom the fix release notes:\n```\nThis feature relies on a beta release (e.g. version 0.5.1) of a Node.js\nmodule on npm--one that was superseded by a stable (e.g. version 1.0)\nrelease published three years ago [2]. Due to a build-time dependency on\nthe long-since deprecated `node-waf` tool, the module at that version\ncan only be built for Node.js versions 0.8 and below.\n\nGiven this, actual usage of this feature is likely very limited. Remove\nit completely so the integrity of this module's core functionality can\nbe verified.\n```\n\n## References\n[1] https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=809252\n[2] https://github.com/node-js-libs/cli/commit/fd6bc4d2a901aabe0bb6067fbcc14a4fe3faa8b9\n",

This allows attackers to send malicious requests while inheriting the identity and privileges of the currently logged in user.\n\n## Details\nCross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated. CSRF attacks specifically target state-changing requests, not theft of data, since the attacker has no way to see the response to the forged request. With a little help of social engineering (such as sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker's choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application.

        "description": "## Overview\n[`ejs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs) is a popular JavaScript templating engine.\nAffected versions of the package are vulnerable to _Remote Code Execution_ by letting the attacker under certain conditions control the source folder from which the engine renders include files.\nYou can read more about this vulnerability on the [Snyk blog](https://snyk.io/blog/fixing-ejs-rce-vuln).\n\nThere's also a [Cross-site Scripting](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ejs:20161130) & [Denial of Service](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ejs:20161130-1) vulnerabilities caused by the same behaviour. \n\n## Details\n`ejs` provides a few different options for you to render a template, two being very similar: `ejs.render()` and `ejs.renderFile()`. The only difference being that `render` expects a string to be used for the template and `renderFile` expects a path to a template file.\n\nBoth functions can be invoked in two ways. The first is calling them with `template`, `data`, and `options`:\n```js\nejs.render(str, data, options);\n\nejs.renderFile(filename, data, options, callback)\n```\nThe second way would be by calling only the `template` and `data`, while `ejs` lets the `options` be passed as part of the `data`:\n```js\nejs.render(str, dataAndOptions);\n\nejs.renderFile(filename, dataAndOptions, callback)\n```\n\nIf used with a variable list supplied by the user (e.g. by reading it from the URI with `qs` or equivalent), an attacker can control `ejs` options. This includes the `root` option, which allows changing the project root for includes with an absolute path.  \n\n```js\nejs.renderFile('my-template', {root:'/bad/root/'}, callback);\n```\n\nBy passing along the root directive in the line above, any includes would now be pulled from `/bad/root` instead of the path intended. This allows the attacker to take control of the root directory for included scripts and divert it to a library under his control, thus leading to remote code execution.\n\nThe [fix](https://github.com/mde/ejs/commit/3d447c5a335844b25faec04b1132dbc721f9c8f6) introduced in version `2.5.3` blacklisted `root` options from options passed via the `data` object.\n\n## Disclosure Timeline\n- November 27th, 2016 - Reported the issue to package owner.\n- November 27th, 2016 - Issue acknowledged by package owner.\n- November 28th, 2016 - Issue fixed and version `2.5.3` released.\n\n## Remediation\nThe vulnerability can be resolved by either using the GitHub integration to [generate a pull-request](https://snyk.io/org/projects) from your dashboard or by running `snyk wizard` from the command-line interface.\nOtherwise, Upgrade `ejs` to version `2.5.3` or higher.\n\n## References\n- [Snyk Blog](https://snyk.io/blog/fixing-ejs-rce-vuln)\n- [Fix commit](https://github.com/mde/ejs/commit/3d447c5a335844b25faec04b1132dbc721f9c8f6)\n\n",

However, a vulnerability that could lead to unescaped content being inserted\ninto the innerHTML string without being sanitized has been identified.\n\n## Details\n\nWhen a primitive value is used as the Handlebars context, that value is not\nproperly escaped.  An example of this would be using the `{{each}}` helper to\niterate over an array of user-supplied strings and using `{{this}}` inside the\nblock to display each string.\n\nIn applications that contain templates whose context is a primitive value and\nuse the `{{this}}` keyword to display that value, a specially-crafted payload\ncould execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the current domain\n(\"XSS\").\n\n**Impact:**\n\nThis vulnerability affects applications that contain templates whose context is\nset to a user-supplied primitive value (such as a string or number) and also\ncontain the `{{this}}` special Handlebars variable to display the value.\n\n## References\n- https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ember-security/1h6FRgr8lXQ\n",

This may lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, assuming an attacker can influence the value entered into the template. If the handlebars template is used to render user-generated content, this vulnerability may escalate to a persistent XSS vulnerability.\n\n## Details\n\n**Example:**\n\nAssume handlebars was used to display user comments and avatar, using the following template: \n`<img src={{avatarUrl}}><pre>{{comment}}</pre>`\n\nIf an attacker spoofed their avatar URL and provided the following value: \n`http://evil.org/avatar.png onload=alert(document.cookie)`\n\nThe resulting HTML would be the following, triggering the script once the image loads:\n`<img src=http://evil.org/avatar.png onload=alert(document.cookie)><pre>Gotcha!</pre>`\n\n## References\n- https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/commit/83b8e846a3569bd366cf0b6bdc1e4604d1a2077e\n",

This allows an attacker to quickly exhaust the sockets on the server, making it unavailable (a `Denial of Service` attack).\n\nThe vulnerability is caused by the combination of two bugs. \nFirst, the underlying V8 engine throws an exception when processing the specially crafted date, instead of stating the date is invalid as it should. Second, the `Hapi` server does not handle the exception well, leading to the socket remaining open.\n\nUpgrading `Hapi` will address the second issue and thus fix the vulnerability.\n\n## References\n- Hapi fix: https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/commit/aab2496e930dce5ee1ab28eecec94e0e45f03580\n- V8 bug: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=4640\n",

The maintainers of JS-YAML have patched this vulnerability and, beginning in version 2.1.0, have provided a safeLoad method for parsing YAML. Developers that use this module should make sure they have upgraded and should strongly consider porting their code to use the new safeLoad method.\n\n_Source: [Node Security Project](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/16)_\n\n### Details\nThe module allowed code execution due to a custom data-type that it defined and parsed called !!js/function. The way it would parse the data was to create a new Function object in JavaScript based on the input, which is equivalent to calling eval on the input:\n\n```\nfunction resolveJavascriptFunction(object /*, explicit*/) {\n  /*jslint evil:true*/\n  var func;\n\n  try {\n    func = new Function('return ' + object);\n    return func();\n  } catch (error) {\n    return NIL;\n  }\n}\n```\nThat meant the code snippet below, when run, would execute code instead of simply defining a function:\n\n```\nvar yaml = require('js-yaml');\n\nx = \"test: !!js/function > \\n  \\\nfunction f() { \\n    \\\nconsole.log(1); \\n  \\\n}();\"\n\nyaml.load(x);\n```\n\n## Remediation\nDevelopers using the JS-YAML module should make sure that they are working with an up-to-date version and should strongly consider porting their code to use safeLoad in place of load, especially when accepting YAML derived from user input.\n\n## References\n\n- [Code Execution via YAML in JS-YAML Node.js Module](https://nealpoole.com/blog/2013/06/code-execution-via-yaml-in-js-yaml-nodejs-module/)\n",

An attacker can then cause a program using a Regular Expression to enter these extreme situations and then hang for a very long time.\" [1]\n\n## References\n\n- https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS",

        "description": "## Overview\n[`marked`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked) is a markdown parser and compiler used for rendering markdown content to html. It is vulnerable to content injection attack allowing the attacker to bypass its output sanitization (`sanitize: true`) protection. Using the [HTML Coded Character Set](https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_13.html#SEC13), attackers can inject `javascript:` code snippets into the output. For example, the following input `javascript&#x58document;alert&#40;1&#41;`  will result in `alert(1)` being executed when the user clicks on the link.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `marked` to version 0.3.6 or higher.\nAlso, you can patch the vulnerability using [Snyk wizard](https://snyk.io/docs/using-snyk/#wizard). Alternatively you can use `remarkable` or other markdown libraries.\n\n## References\n- [Github PR](https://github.com/chjj/marked/pull/592)\n- [Github Commit](https://github.com/chjj/marked/pull/592/commits/2cff85979be8e7a026a9aca35542c470cf5da523)\n",

An attacker can then cause a program using a Regular Expression to enter these extreme situations and then hang for a very long time.\" [1](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `ms` to version 0.7.1. \n\nIf direct dependency upgrade is not possible, use [snyk wizard](https://snyk.io/docs/using-snyk#wizard) to patch this vulnerability.\n\n## References\n\n- https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS\n",

This may lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, assuming an attacker can influence the value entered into the template. If the mustache template is used to render user-generated content, this vulnerability may escalate to a persistent XSS vulnerability.\n\n## Example\nFor example, assume mustache was used to display user comments, using the following template: \n`<a href={{email}}>{{name}}</a><pre>{{comment}}</pre>`\n\nIf an attacker spoofed his email address and provided the following value: \n`jane@evil.org onload=alert(document.cookie)`\n\nThe resulting HTML would be: \n`<a href=wizard@evil.org onload=alert(document.cookie)>Evil Wizard</a><pre>Busted!</pre>`\n\n## References\n\n- https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/commit/378bcca8a5cfe4058f294a3dbb78e8755e8e0da5\n",

Versions prior to `0.6.1` are vulnerable to [Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS) attack when parsing \"Accept-Language\" http header.\n\nAn attacker can provide a long value in the Accept-Language header, which nearly matches the pattern being matched. This will cause the regular expression matching to take a long time, all the while occupying the thread and preventing it from processing other requests. By repeatedly sending multiple such requests, the attacker can make the server unavailable (a Denial of Service attack).\n\n## Details\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a Denial of Service attack, that exploits the fact that most Regular Expression implementations may reach extreme situations that cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size). An attacker can then cause a program using a Regular Expression to enter these extreme situations and then hang for a very long time.

Both the key and a message serve as input to this algorithm, while it outputs a fixed-length digest output which can be sent with the message. Anyone who knows the key can repeat the algorithm and compare their calculated HMAC with one they have received, to verify a message originated from someone with knowledge of the key and has not been tampered with.\n\nThe problem begins when trying to compare two HMACs.\nThis is the part of code that handles the comparison:\n\n```js\nif(byteArrayA.length != byteArrayB.length) { return false; }\nfor(int i = 0; i < byteArrayA.length; i++) {\n  if(byteArrayA[i] != byteArrayB[i]) { return false; }\n}\nreturn true;\n```\nThe issue is that the more bytes match in the two arrays, the more comparisons are formed and the longer it'll take to return a result. This may allow attackers to brute force their way into the servers.\n\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `node-forge` to version 0.6.33 or higher.\n\n## References\n- [Github Commit](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/17c6aaf2fa3bb0fc8756c561c541dd8e8127e1dd)\n- [NCCGroup Blog](https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blog/2011/february/double-hmac-verification/)\n- [Nate Lawson's Blog](https://rdist.root.org/2010/07/19/exploiting-remote-timing-attacks/)\n",

The attacker could do anything the compromised users could do, including publishing new versions of packages.\n\n## Details\nThe primary npm registry has, since late 2014, used HTTP bearer tokens to authenticate requests from the npm command-line interface. Due to a design flaw in the CLI, these bearer tokens were sent with every request made by logged-in users, regardless of the destination of the request. (The bearers only should have been included for requests made against a registry or registries used for the current install.)\n\nThis flaw allows an attacker to set up an HTTP server that could collect authentication information. They could then use this information to impersonate the users whose tokens they collected. This impersonation would allow them to do anything the compromised users could do, including publishing new versions of packages.\n\nWith the fixes npm have released, the CLI will only send bearer tokens with requests made against a registry.\nnpm’s CLI team believe that the fix won’t break any existing registry setups. However, it’s possible the change will be breaking in some cases, due to the large number of registry software suites used.\n\n## Remediation\n1. Upgrade npm to \">= 3.8.3 || >= 2.15.1\"\n2.

        "description": "## Overview\n`nunjucks` is a powerful templating engine.\n\nLike many templating engines, it automatically HTML encodes any `string` value included in the template using the `{{ some-variable }}` notation. These variables are often user-generated, but the HTML Encoding protects the application from Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\nHowever, if the variable passed in is an array, no HTML encoding is applied, exposing an easy path to XSS. The risk of exploit is especially high given the fact `express`, `koa` and many other Node.js servers allow users to force a query parameter to be an array using the `param[]=value` notation.\n\n## Details\n\nThe [issue](https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks/issues/835) opened by [Matt Austin](https://github.com/matt-) explains the vulnerability very well:\n\n> The following string works as expected:\n```\nvar res = nunjucks.renderString('Hello {{ username }}', { username: '<s>Matt</s>' });\nconsole.log(res); //Hello &lt;s&gt;Matt&lt;/s&gt;\n```\n\n> If however the variable passed to the template is an array autoescape does nothing:\n```\nvar res = nunjucks.renderString('Hello {{ username }}', { username: ['<s>Matt</s>'] });\nconsole.log(res); // Hello <s>Matt</s>\n```\n...\n> In express / Koa / (anything else using qs or body-parser) is is trivial to coerce query params types. See the following simple example in express:\n```\nvar app = express();\nvar env = nunjucks.configure('views', {\n    autoescape: true,\n    express: app\n});\napp.get('/', function(req, res) {     \n    // This should be fine autoescape is on...\n    res.send(nunjucks.renderString('Hello {{ username }}', { username: req.query.name }));\n    //res.render('index.html', { username: req.query.name });\n});\n```\n\n> Attack URL:\n`http://127.0.0.1:3000/?name[]=<script>alert(1)</script>matt`\n\nA more complete proof of concept (POC) can be found here: https://github.com/matt-/nunjucks_test\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade to `nunjucks` version 2.4.3 or newer.\n\n## References\n- https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks/issues/835\n- https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks/pull/836\n- https://github.com/matt-/nunjucks_test\n",

        "description": "## Overview\n[`request`][https://www.npmjs.com/package/request] is a simplified http request client.\nA potential remote memory exposure vulnerability exists in `request`. If a `request` uses a multipart attachment and the _body type_ option is `number` with value X, then X bytes of uninitialized memory will be sent in the body of the request.\n\nNote that while the impact of this vulnerability is high (memory exposure), exploiting it is likely difficult, as the attacker needs to somehow control the body type of the request. One potential exploit scenario is when a request is composed based on JSON input, including the body type, allowing a malicious JSON to trigger the memory leak.\n\n### Details\nConstructing a `Buffer` class with integer `N` creates a `Buffer`\nof length `N` with non zero-ed out memory.\n**Example:**\n```\nvar x = new Buffer(100); // uninitialized Buffer of length 100\n// vs\nvar x = new Buffer('100'); // initialized Buffer with value of '100'\n```\n\nInitializing a multipart body in such manner will cause uninitialized memory to be sent in the body of the request.\n\n#### Proof of concept\n```javascript\nvar http = require('http')\nvar request = require('request')\n\nhttp.createServer(function (req, res) {\n  var data = ''\n  req.setEncoding('utf8')\n  req.on('data', function (chunk) {\n    console.log('data')\n    data += chunk\n  })\n  req.on('end', function () {\n    // this will print uninitialized memory from the client\n    console.log('Client sent:\\n', data)\n  })\n  res.end()\n}).listen(8000)\n\nrequest({\n  method: 'POST',\n  uri: 'http://localhost:8000',\n  multipart: [{ body: 1000 }]\n},\nfunction (err, res, body) {\n  if (err) return console.error('upload failed:', err)\n  console.log('sent')\n})\n```\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `request` to version 2.68.0 or higher.\n\nIf a direct dependency update is not possible, use [`snyk wizard`](https://snyk.io/documentation/#wizard) to patch this vulnerability.\n\n## References\n- [Github PR](https://github.com/request/request/pull/2018)\n- [Blog: Node Buffer API fix](https://github.com/ChALkeR/notes/blob/master/Lets-fix-Buffer-API.md#previous-materials)\n- [Blog: Information about Buffer](https://github.com/ChALkeR/notes/blob/master/Buffer-knows-everything.md)\n",

        "description": "## Overview\nThe semver module uses regular expressions when parsing a version string. For a carefully crafted input, the time it takes to process these regular expressions is not linear to the length of the input. Since the semver module did not enforce a limit on the version string length, an attacker could provide a long string that would take up a large amount of resources, potentially taking a server down. This issue therefore enables a potential Denial of Service attack. This is a slightly differnt variant of a typical Regular Expression Denial of Service ([ReDoS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)) vulnerability.\n\n## Remediation\nUpdate to a version 4.3.2 or greater. From the issue description [2]: \"Package version can no longer be more than 256 characters long. This prevents a situation in which parsing the version number can use exponentially more time and memory to parse, leading to a potential denial of service.\"\n\n## References\n\n- [1] https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS\n- [2] https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.7.5\n",

Make sure your installation of browserify is using syntax-error@1.1.1 or later. \n\n_Source: [Node Security Project](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/37)_\n\n## Details\n\nThe vulnerability involves breaking out of Function(), which was used to check syntax for more informative errors. In node 0.10, Function() seems to be implemented in terms of eval(), so malicious code can execute even if the function returned by Function() was never called. node 0.11 does not appear to be vulnerable.\n\nThanks to [Cal Leeming] (cal@iops.io) for discovering and disclosing this bug!\n\n## Remediation\nUpdate to version 1.1.1 or greater.

This access_key is intended to protect the API admin from unauthorized access.\n\nThe key is checked by checking to see if the access_key provided in the request is within the configured access_key string, not equal to. So a single character that's within the access key is sufficient to bypass this control.\n\n_Source: [Node Security Project](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/38)_\n\n## Details\n\n**Example:**\n\nThis is the snippet of code that does the comparison to authorize requests.\n\n```\nif (access_key && config.master.api.access_key.indexOf(access_key) !== -1) {\n```\n\nFor an access_key that is set to anything that includes the letter 'a' the following request would be authorized.\n\n```\n$ curl -X POST \"http://localhost:8081/api/exec\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d @test -H \"access-key: a\"\n{\n \"cmd\": \"ls\",\n \"path\": \".\",\n \"stdout\": \"app.js\\nconfig.js\\nlog\\nnode_modules\\nserver.js\\n\",\n \"stderr\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\n**Mitigating factors:**\n\nThe admin interface is disabled by default. The module author confirmed that the access_key should really be an array of access_keys, however based on variable name and documentation it was not clear that it should be an array. The vulnerability exists only if a string access_key is set.\n\nModule version 0.0.6 has been updated to ensure an array of keys is provided as well as documentation updates.\n\n## References\n\n",

This bug was [demonstrated](https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/backdooring-js/) by [Yan](https://twitter.com/bcrypt) to allow potentially malicious code to be hidden within secure code, activated by minification.\n\n_Source: [Node Security Project](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/39)_\n\n\n### Details\n\nIn Boolean algebra, DeMorgan's laws describe the relationships between conjunctions ( && ), disjunctions ( || ) and negations ( ! ).\nIn Javascript form, they state that:\n !(a && b) === (!a) || (!b)\n !(a || b) === (!a) && (!b)\n\nThe law does not hold true when one of the values is not a boolean however.\n\nVulnerable versions of UglifyJS do not account for this restriction, and erroneously apply the laws to a statement if it can be reduced in length by it.\n\nConsider this authentication function:\n\n```\nfunction isTokenValid(user) {\n    var timeLeft =\n        !!config && // config object exists\n        !!user.token && // user object has a token\n        !user.token.invalidated && // token is not explicitly invalidated\n        !config.uninitialized && // config is initialized\n        !config.ignoreTimestamps && // don't ignore timestamps\n        getTimeLeft(user.token.expiry); // > 0 if expiration is in the future\n\n    // The token must not be expired\n    return timeLeft > 0;\n}\n\nfunction getTimeLeft(expiry) {\n  return expiry - getSystemTime();\n}\n```\nWhen minified with a vulnerable version of UglifyJS, it will produce the following insecure output, where a token will never expire:\n\n( Formatted for readability )\n\n```\nfunction isTokenValid(user) {\n    var timeLeft = !(                       // negation\n        !config                             // config object does not exist\n        || !user.token                      // user object does not have a token\n        || user.token.invalidated           // token is explicitly invalidated\n        || config.uninitialized             // config isn't initialized\n        || config.ignoreTimestamps          // ignore timestamps\n        || !getTimeLeft(user.token.expiry)  // > 0 if expiration is in the future\n    );\n    return timeLeft > 0\n}\n\nfunction getTimeLeft(expiry) {\n    return expiry - getSystemTime()\n}\n```\n\n## Remediation\n\nUpgrade UglifyJS to version >= 2.4.24.\n\n## References\n\n- https://github.com/tmcw/mdast-uglify-bug\n- https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/backdooring-js/\n- https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/issues/751\n",

        "description": "## Overview\nThe validator module for Node.js contains functionality meant to filter potential XSS attacks (a filter called xss). A method of\nbypassing the filter via an encoded URL has been publicly disclosed. In general, because the function’s filtering is blacklist-based it is likely that other bypasses will be discovered in the future. Developers are encouraged not to use the xss filter function in this package.\n\n_Source: [Node Security Project](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/43)_\n\n### Details\nThe xss() function removes the word \"javascript\" when contained inside an attribute. However, it does not properly handle cases where\ncharacters have been hex-encoded. As a result, it is possible to build an input that bypasses the filter but which the browser will accept as valid JavaScript.\n\nFor example, browsers interpret <a href=\"jav&#x61;script:...\">abc</a> as <a href=\"javascript:...\">abc</a>.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade to the latest version of this library. However, it should be noted that the fix for this vulnerability was to remove the xss filter functionality. Seek another library to provide proper output encoding.\n\n## References\n\n- https://github.com/chriso/validator.js/issues/181\n",

Developers are encouraged not to use the xss filter function in this package.\n\n_Source: [Node Security Project](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/41)_\n\n### Details\nVarious inputs that could bypass the filter were discovered:\n\nImproper parsing of nested tags:\n\n```\n<s <onmouseover=\"alert(1)\"> <;s onmouseover=\"alert(1)\">This is a test</s>\n```\n\nIncomplete filtering of javascript: URIs:\n\n```\n<a href=\"javascriptJ a V a S c R iPt::alert(1)\" \"<s>\">test</a>\n```\n\nUI Redressing:\n\n```\n<div style=\"z-index: 9999999; background-color: green; width: 100%; height: 100%\">\n<h1>You have won</h1>Please click the link and enter your login details:\n<a href=\"http://example.com/\">http://good.com</a>\n</div>\n```\n\nBypass via Nested Forbidden Strings:\n\n```\n<scrRedirecRedirect 302t 302ipt type=\"text/javascript\">prompt(1);</scrRedirecRedirect 302t 302ipt>\n```\n\nAdditional bypasses were discovered by Krzysztof Kotowicz in 2012 when auditing CodeIgniter's XSS filtering function, which this code was based off of.\n\n## Remediation\nIf you are a developer currently using the xss filter function from the validator package, you should consider replacing it with the escape filter function from the same package. This function replaces all instances of angle brackets (<, >), ampersands, and quotation marks, so no HTML tags will be processed.\n\n## References\n\n- [XSS Filter Bypass in validator Node.js Module](https://nealpoole.com/blog/2013/07/xss-filter-bypass-in-validator-nodejs-module/)\n- [CodeIgniter <= 2.1.1 xss_clean() Cross Site Scripting filter bypass](http://blog.kotowicz.net/2012/07/codeigniter-210-xssclean-cross-site.html)\n",

In those speeds, a payload of this size can be transmitted in seconds.\n\n## Remediation\nUpdate to version 1.1.1 or greater, which sets a default `maxPayload` of 100MB.\nIf you cannot upgrade, apply a Snyk patch, or provide `ws` with options setting the `maxPayload` to an appropriate size that is smaller than 256MB.\n\n## References\n- WS Issue: https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/0328a8f49f004f98d2913016214e93b2fc2713bc\n- Resulting crash in Node: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/7388\n\n\n",

        "description": "## Overview\n[`xd-testing`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xd-testing) is a testing library for cross-device (XD) web applications.\n\nAffected versions of the package are vulnerable to Man in the Middle (MitM) attacks due to downloading resources over an insecure protocol. Without a secure connection, it is possible for an attacker to intercept this connection and alter the packages received. In serious cases, this may even lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on your host server.\n\n## Remediation\nThere is no fix version for `xd-testing`.\n",
